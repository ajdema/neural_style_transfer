# Adoration of the Magi Style Transfer

This project was inspired by my fascination with Leonardo Da Vinci's renowned masterpiece, "Adoration of the Magi." Intrigued by the idea of completing this unfinished work, I embarked on a journey exploring artistic possibilities. After some consideration, I decided to experiment with neural style transfer, using the original incomplete painting as the content image and a different finished piece by Da Vinci as the style image.

The initial attempt, while not entirely successful, proved to be an engaging exercise. Despite the challenges, I successfully constructed a neural style transfer model, delving into the fascinating intersection of art and technology.

Looking ahead, I plan to further explore this artistic challenge by applying diffusion as an alternative approach. The project is a testament to my commitment to pushing the boundaries of creativity and leveraging innovative techniques.

## Key Features:
- Neural style transfer implementation
- Inspired by Leonardo Da Vinci's "Adoration of the Magi"
- Future plans to explore diffusion-based solutions

## References:
Much of the conceptual groundwork for the style transfer implementation is derived from the research paper [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) by Gatys et al.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to the evolution of this artistic endeavor. Your creativity is welcome!

**Note:** This project is a work in progress, and updates will be added as new developments unfold.
